question 1:

reaguler file -> .txt, .py, .jpj
directory -> are the folders
device file -> it contains the files of the hardware devices sush as mouse, keyboard, hard disk
               there is two types character device and block device
               character device-> data is handeld one character at a time. ex:/dev/tty for the terminal
               block device-> data handeld in blocks (chunks) ex: /dev/sda for the hard disk
symbolic file-> it is a file that is pointing at another file, its inode is different that the original file inode.if the orginal file deleted the data is 
                lost

check them with ls -l


question 2:

symbolic link-> different inode from the original file, points at the orginal file, deleting the orginal file will make the symbolic file useless bec data
                will be gone

hard ling-> same inode as original file, points at the same data as the original, deleteing the original file won't make a problem the original will be still
            working 

they are the same-> if we changed anything in any of the symbolic link or hard link the change will be implemented in the orginal file


question 3:

rm -r -> removes the directory and all of its contents recursively
rmdir -> can only remove empty directories
